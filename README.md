### For developers
Running xTc in dev mode *should* be simple. If the instructions below aren't
working then please open an issue.

- Clone the repo
- `npm i`
- In terminal 1: `npm run dev-watch-files`
- In terminal 2, once terminal 1 is done: `npm run dev-launch-electron`

After you edit some files, restart terminal 2 to re-launch electron. No need
to touch terminal 1.
